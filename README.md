Designed and implemented an Airport Flight Management System to manage and track flight information, including schedules, bookings, and passenger details. The system efficiently handle operations such as adding new flights, updating flight 
information, deleting flights, and querying flight details based on various criteria. Also, generated reports for flights by status (e.g., all scheduled flights, all cancelled flights). Used appropriate data structures to manage flight and 
passenger records in C++. This project is developed in collaboration with my colleagues from college.
